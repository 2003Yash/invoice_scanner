{text}

Please identify:
1. PO Number/Reference Number
2. Determine if this is a NEW purchase order being created or a REFERENCE to an existing purchase order
   - Look for phrases like "new PO", "I'd like to place an order", etc. to identify new orders
   - Look for phrases like "regarding PO", "follow up on", "status of PO" to identify references
3. Part Numbers/Item Codes/MPNs (list all mentioned)
4. Quantities for each item

Look for items in various formats including:
- Lines starting with "QTY-" followed by a number and then an item code
- Bullet points with items and quantities (e.g., "- SS-R4S8: 2 units")
- Table formats with item codes and quantities

DO NOT include email metadata (From, To, Date, Subject) as items.
DO NOT include dates as items.
DO NOT include general text like "I like to place an order" as items.
ONLY include actual product/part numbers or clearly labeled items.

Critical patterns to extract:
- (123x) ITEM-CODE - where 123 is quantity and ITEM-CODE is the item
- (123) ITEM-CODE - where 123 is quantity and ITEM-CODE is the item
- QTY x ITEM-CODE
- ITEM-CODE - QTY pcs
- ITEM-CODE (QTY)

Example line to extract: "(308x) SS-4-VCR-2-BL (make sure they are not silver coated)"
From this line: quantity = 308, item = SS-4-VCR-2-BL

New table format to extract data

| Item Code | Description              | Quantity | Unit Price | Total     |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------|------------|-----------|

EXTRACTION RULES:
- Look for the pattern "(number followed by optional x) followed by item code" 
- For part numbers, look for alphanumeric codes with hyphens like SS-4-VCR-2-BL
- Ignore any text in parentheses that appears after the item code (like specifications or notes)
- DO NOT include email metadata (From, To, Date, Subject) as items
- DO NOT include dates as items
- DO NOT extract dates as PO numbers
- DO NOT include general text like "I like to place an order" as items
- ONLY extract actual product/part numbers or clearly labeled items

Task:
1. Carefully analyze if this data represents a new purchase order that is requesting specific items to be purchased.
2. A NEW purchase order MUST include:
   - A PO number (this is mandatory for classification as a purchase order)
   - Specific items to be purchased with quantities
   - Product codes or SKUs
   - Often has order date or delivery date

3. If the document lacks a PO number, it should be classified as a quotation, not a purchase order.

4. The following are NOT new purchase orders:
   - Terms and conditions documents about purchase orders
   - Explanations of purchasing processes
   - Past order summaries or receipts
   - General contract language
   - Meeting notes, emails, or other business documents
   - Quotations (which lack a PO number)

# - Return "NA" if any required field is not explicitly mentioned in the PO
# - "customer_item_id" for Customer Item ID (unique ID or Material ID for each item)(Present in item ID column)
# - "manufacturer_item_id" for Manufacturer Item ID (if available, else return "NA")(Generally present in item description column)
# - "item_description" for Item Description (preserve all special characters, dimensions, specifications, etc. exactly as they appear)
# - "quantity" for Quantity
# - "unit_price" for Unit Price (preserve currency symbols, commas, periods, and all formatting exactly as they appear)(Just include numeric values and currency symbols nothing else)
# - "total_price" for Total Price (preserve currency symbols, commas, periods, and all formatting exactly as they appear)

# ## Important Rules:
# Make sure manufacturer_item_id should be extracted from the item description column, if available.
# examples of manufacturer_item_id that will be generally present in item description: GDP00500, HC224VCR3S4TB7, SS-8-TA-1-6
# Always look for "Item No.", "Item Number", or similar column headers for customer_item_id
# customer_item_id will not be serial number like 001,002 and so on , it will be unique ID or Material ID for each item.
# Combine multi-line descriptions by removing line breaks
# Ensure each item is extracted, even with identical item_descriptions
# Preserve exact formatting of prices and quantities
# Use contextual clues to distinguish item fields if standard headers are absent
# Do Not return serial number in customer_item_id or manufacturer_item_id fields.
# Follow sample input and output format regarding the customer_item_id, manufacturer_item_id, item_description, quantity, unit_price, and total_price fields.

# Do not modify or remove any special characters from the item_description, unit_price, or total_price fields, as these contain important information about specifications, dimensions, and numerical formatting that varies by language and region.

def get_amendment_prompt(amendments, po_data):
    prompt = f"""You are a helpful assistant that updates purchase order data based on recognized changes. Your task is to:

1. Take a PO data object and a change log object as inputs
2. Apply the changes from the change log to the PO data
3. Return the updated PO data as a JSON object

Here is the change log that contains the recognized changes:
{amendments}

Here is the PO data that needs to be updated:
{po_data}

Follow these rules when applying changes:
- If a field in the change log exactly matches a field in the PO data, update that field with the new value
- If a field in the change log doesn't exactly match but is logically similar to a field in the PO data, update the logically similar field
- If a field in the change log doesn't exist in the PO data at all, then add it to the PO data
- Preserve the original structure of the PO data
- Do not remove or modify any fields that aren't mentioned in the change log
- Use the field names that already exist in the PO data whenever possible
- for updates over "instructions" datafield, take the new data and append it to already existing data, instead of removing old data and updating with new data

When looking for logically similar fields, consider these mappings (but don't limit yourself to only these):
- "DeliveryDate" might map to fields in "delivery_details" section
- "payment_terms" might map to "payment_terms" in "order_details" section
- Item-specific changes might map to entries in the "items" array



Your response should contain only the updated PO data as a valid JSON object, with no additional explanation or commentary.
